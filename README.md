Chrome extension for saving links

This extension was created by following a JavaScript course on Scrimba.com. The purpose of the extension is to save links found on the internet (rather than collecting bookmarks). In the future, I would like to adjust some of the wording and the icon to reflect something more personal such as dev home pages, cheatsheets, or links I'm using for a specific project.

The HMTL is standard, but the instructor did introduce a few new concepts and naming conventions I plan on using in the future. The CSS is straightforward (I will be changing the color theme later).

I did learn quite a few new JavaScript principles including template strings and writing cleaner DOM manipulation. His tip was "Make it work first, then make it better"
